# CS300-Final

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**
The problem I was tasked with was to develop an application that would allow users to manage and retrieve information about courses in a computer science program. This involved loading the course data from a file that would then be organized into appropriate data structures. From there functionality like displaying and searching for course information were implemented. 

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
I started by first analyzing the requirements and identifying the core functionalities that the application needed to provide. I chose the appropriate data structures (vectors, hash tables, and binary search) based on the operation required. Data structures are crucial because they directly affect the efficiency and performance of the application. By choosing the right data structure for the right task, I was able to optimize the application's speed and memory usage, ensuring it could handle large sets of data effectively.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
I encountered several roadblocks, such as handling file I/O operations, debugging segmentation faults, and ensuring the data was correctly parsed and stored in the chosen data structures. To overcome these obstacles, I used systemic debugging techniques like logging to track the programsâ€™ behavior and identify root causes of issues. I also simplified the code when necessary to reduce complexity and minimize the likelihood of errors.  I also implemented error handling to ensure that the program could manage unexpected situations such as missing or improper formatted files.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
This project helped reinforce the importance of planning and designing before diving into programing. By focusing on requirements and designing the data structures and flow of the program upfront, I was able to create a more tailored and scalable solution. It also highlighted the importance of flexibility in software design, allowing for changes and improvements without needing to rewrite large portions of the code. This experience has made me more mindful of the design phase and the need to consider future adaptability and maintenance when writing software.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
This project has significantly enhanced my approach to writing code that is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. I focused on writing clean, well-organized code with clear and descriptive names for variables and functions, making the code easier to understand and follow. I also emphasized the use of comments to explain complex logic, which not only aids in immediate comprehension but also ensures that the code is easier to revisit and modify in the future.
